# About This Minecraft Launcher
This launcher is designed to be a modular, modern, and highly customizable Minecraft launcher experience. It uses Python for backend that keeps everything lightweight, fast, and fully scriptable.

# Accounts 
## Microsoft (mojang)
This is achieved by using localhost and embedding a page in Qt6 env. If that fails, then it will use browser localhost to connect. It's safe for you to use this, because the launcher gets the token from the Microsoft servers, not from me! Token is required to indentify if you are legit owner of your account.

## Offline (cracked)
Simply enter username and boom you have that account, and you can use it only on cracked servers (`offline-mode=false`) and singleplayer. Though, you can't have a custom skin bc you cracked it! 
I'm not resposible for any legal damage, nor im Mojang or Xbox studios.
